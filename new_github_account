If you lost 2-FA and cannot find recovery code, here are troubles you might face:
1. Unlink email address(es) associated to the (old) account.
2. Use the email address to create a new account
3. Optional: follow old account for tracking.

With new account, I endounted the following errors when performing git operations as normal:
1.
remote: You must verify your email address.
remote: See https://github.com/settings/emails.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403

2. 
run: git push https://fredms2:<password>@github.com/Azure/azureml-examples
got:
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
remote: Please see https://docs.github.com/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on currently recommended modes of authentication.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/'

3. Follow stack overflow answers:
run: git config --global user.email <email_address>
run: git config --global user.name fredms2
run: git config --list

4. Get permissions
